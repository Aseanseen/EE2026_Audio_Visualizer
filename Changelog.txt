EE volume / freq history display
	- placed at the bottom left of the graph	
	- the problem with the original code is that the full history bar (for some odd reason)
	has empty spaces, we can compensate for this by overlaying the bar again
		- range has been narrowed down in order to not make this look terrible (the bar will jump at some point)
		
	- Toggling the display
		- changed at mode 5 options
			option states:
			0. turned off
			1. turned on (base sound wave)
			2. sound wave volume
			3. freq wave
			
	- menu drawing for the display
	- background
		-
	
	border
	- use the original border for that color scheme, but make it darker
	- for base sound wave, have a specific line at the middle to demarcate the middle point
	
Note: prob with frequency ? 
	- atm it samples for 1s and returns the number of crossings
	- can do continuous sampling
		- have to figure out how much to delete at each point (use reg memory to store?)
	
//stuff to check tmr:
check if the history waveform fills the entire bar
	- decide if the speed and waveform looks good

Stuff to work on:
	Dan - 
		Volume / frequency history cleanup
		* - % char in decoder doesnt work, will look into it sometime later
		need to bind maximum option settings to modes 4 and above
		re-do the freq calculator, so it measures in real time instead of every 1s
			especially need this for the freq waveforms
		finish up those alternate waveforms (thurs night)
		
		Last feature (if there's time)
			- Make a musical tuner from this (set to mode 7)
			- Basically take the freq given, and output a specific note (will need to lookup the values)
			
			- possibly rebind the history code for special nyan cat mode

29.3.19
	Dan:
		Merged color changing state code
		Added frequency sampling code (Mode 4):
			Finds the number of crossings per second, using the 20KHz clock to sample
			May be unreliable if background noise is too big
			
30.3.19
	Dan:
		Cleaned up frequency sampling code
		Added sound percentage level code
		Added switching options for mode 4
			Mode 4 now displays different parameters:
			Frequency
			Sound level in %
			
31.3.19
	Dan:
		Added alternate waveform mode selector
		Binded original waveform to waveform 0 in mode 4
		Added filled waveform (waveform 1) and block waveform (waveform 2)
		
3.4.19
	Dan:
		Added waveform history
		Added circle waveform
		Remapped mode selector
			Now states are set via center button click
			Code now remembers previously set states, and shows you all available options in each mode
			After switching back, previous state is loaded
		Added LED15 to show lock status
		
4.4.19
	Dan:
		Merged code w. JY
		Fixed history waveform
