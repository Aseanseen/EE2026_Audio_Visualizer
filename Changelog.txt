7SEG Volume Indicator (0-12)

Sound wave frequency indicator
Sound wave volume percentage indicator

Multiple waveform displays

Color scheme change mode

Mode Selector:
7SEG Menu Display
	- How to use:
		Press button up / down to toggle between the various modes
		Press button left / right to toggle between the options for that mode
		Press button centre to confirm and lock in choice (except in mode 1 & 2)

Stuff to work on:
	Dan - 
		

29.3.19
	Dan:
		Merged color changing state code
		Added frequency sampling code (Mode 4):
			Finds the number of crossings per second, using the 20KHz clock to sample
			May be unreliable if background noise is too big
			
30.3.19
	Dan:
		Cleaned up frequency sampling code
		Added sound percentage level code
		Added switching options for mode 4
			Mode 4 now displays different parameters:
			Frequency
			Sound level in %
			
31.3.19
	Dan:
		Added alternate waveform mode selector
		Binded original waveform to waveform 0 in mode 4
		Added filled waveform (waveform 1) and block waveform (waveform 2)
		
3.4.19
	Dan:
		Added waveform history
		Added circle waveform
		Remapped mode selector
			Now states are set via center button click
			Code now remembers previously set states, and shows you all available options in each mode
			After switching back, previous state is loaded
		Added LED15 to show lock status
		
4.4.19
	Dan:
		Merged code w. JY
		Fixed history waveform
		
	JY:
		Added buttons to display
		
	Dan:
		Binded buttons to states

6.4.19
	Dan:
		Fixed weird issue with circle waveforms with falloff
		Added music tuner mode to parameter display
